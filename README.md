#üçï - Pizz'App
When I deliver pizzas and I have to go to a residence that has a code, I always have to look in my notes, or the client did not specify the entry code, in short , a waste of time that can be solved.  
I therefore created this web application to be able to add residences with the address, a code if there is one, and additional information.

Work with it personnal [API](https://github.com/ecandotti/PizzAPI.git)

Use :  
- ReactJS
- React Router
- React Icons
- FuseJS
- node-fetch (to dialog with api)

## Use the project  
- git clone https://github.com/ecandotti/PizzApp.git
- cd (the folder)  
- npm i  
- npm start  

It can be download from your navigator.
